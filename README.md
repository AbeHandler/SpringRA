### A Review of the Attention Economy for Information Systems Research

_Are people rationally allocating their attention to deal with boredom/find information that is relevant to their lives? Or are their brains being fracked by the technology firms against their will?_

## Overview

- This document describes a project plan for Spring 2026 for a graduate research assistant from the Leeds School of Business.
- **The goal is to write an ICIS review paper** on the attention economy and how the attention economy presents new questions and new directions for platform researchers in IS.
- The intended consumers of the survey are IS scholars interested in platforms and online ecosystems, who may not have considered the specific role that such platforms play in shaping and directing our attention.

## Major questions

- There are two main questions. Each question corresponds to an area to review. Each also corresponds to a sub-unit for the RA.

- **Q1.** What are the big open questions about the attention economy within IS, as well as within reference disciplines like economics? What are the big open questions within peer disciplines like strategy, management, and marketing? How has the attention economy been conceptualized and theorized in these areas? How has it been studied in practice? What are the grand challenges? Look at FT50, Basket of Eight, and Econ to start. There may also be relevant work in Psych. What has been published about the attention economy in these areas?
- **Q2.** What has been published about the specific features of platform information systems such as like buttons, comments, recommendation algorithms, friending, etc. How do these bigger questions about the attention economy from Q1 relate to specific aspects of the technology from Q2?
	- Tony thinks it may be good to focus specifically on the role of algorithms for Q2. Abe thinks that is OK. The key thing for an IS audience will be to center IS artifacts as a core part of the study.
	- Here is a toy example of how to center the IS artifact. Maybe economics conceptualizes the attention economy as matching consumer interests with niche content. That conceptualization may be a better fit for platforms with a search bar (go find stuff you are interested in) and a worse fit for platforms with recommendation systems (draw your attention to something). 


## Goals

- **Primary goal**: Submit an ICIS review paper in May 2026
- **Secondary goal**: Learn about the attention economy for future study of the YouTube recommendation algorithm
- **Stretch goal**: Convert the ICIS submission into the lit review for a journal paper on the YouTube algorithm. MISQ also has a theory and review section but I think it is very hard to get into.

## Project plan

- **Phase 1**: Review of work on the attention economy in IS, economics and reference disciplines (6 weeks)
	- 1. What has been written about this in Econ?
	- 2. What has been written about this in FT50 journals?
	- 3. What has been written about this in IS, starting with the Basket of Eight? For example, Brynjolfsson, Kim, and Oh have a paper in ISR (2024): The Attention Economy: Measuring the Value of Free Goods on the Internet.
- **Phase 2**: Review of specific affordances of platform information systems (6 weeks)
	- 1. What has been written about this in CS, psych, and marketing? We will need to narrow down the affordances systematically somehow.
	- 2. It may be good to focus on the specific role of **algorithms** (recommendation algorithm or other kinds of algorithms, algorithm change, algorithmic governance/design, etc.). Tony thinks the role of algorithms in the governance/design/orchestration of digital platforms/communities is understudied.
- **Phase 3**: Writing and discussion (4 weeks)
	- Write up the work from the previous two phases.
	- Something to consider for discussion: how do these big questions from reference disciplines, and known findings about specific affordances relate to ongoing conversations within IS. For example, within IS, there is a literature on recommendation systems. How do big questions about the attention economy and specific affordances of online systems introduce new questions for this research area?

## Expectations

- The research assistant (RA) is expected to work 20 hours per week on the project, following the weekly project plan outlined in this repo.
- The supervisor is expected to meet weekly with the RA for 30 minutes to provide feedback and assess progress on the project plan.
- There are 16 folders in the repo under the `weekly` folder corresponding to the 16 weeks of planned work (20 hr/wk).
- Each of the 16 folders contains a markdown report (`report.md`) listing the deliverables for that week.
- The supervisor and RA will use the `weekly` folders to monitor progress. The supervisor and RA will fill out the markdown files in each weekly folder as we go. 
- The supervisor is responsible for emailing a copy of the weekly markdown report to the graduate program director (GPD) to provide a progress update.
- The supervisor expects that the research assistant meets each weekly deliverable on the project. 
- It should be possible to complete the deliverable in 2 full days of work, more or less. If it seems like the deliverables are too demanding or not demanding enough, the RA and the supervisor can adjust as needed. 

## Important deadlines and weekly time table
- The supervisor will review weekly deliverables every **Friday at 5:00 PM**.
- The RA is responsible for submitting all weekly deliverables to this repo by **Friday at 5:00 PM**.
- The RA supervisor will email a copy of the weekly `report.md` to the graduate program director by **Monday at 5:00 PM**.

## Tools
- The RA is encouraged to use AI tools. However, the RA is ultimately responsible for both the correctness and quality of their work.
- Whenever possible, please add all deliverables to this repo.
- Please use [dvc](https://dvc.org/) for any big files that you can't fit in this repo.

## Tensions
- Are people rationally allocating their attention to deal with boredom or seek entertainment. Or are their brains being fracked by the technology firms against their will? That gets at big questions around free will and rational choice. Can we connect those to our specific YT setting? Maybe people need to watch YT becuase they are stuck in places or situations where they need entertainment.

## Attention
- Sometimes divided into automatic vs directed. The Ocasio papers talk about this. So does the Chris Hayes book. Do you direct your attention (e.g. reading a sign) or is it directed for you (e.g., when someone is talking on their phone during a movie). This may be important in our setting.

## Pointers

- In psychology, Herbert Simon first discussed the scarcity of attention.  Famous quote: "A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."
- In economics, [Sendhil Mullainathan (MIT)](https://sendhil.org/) has written quite a bit on the economics of attention. 
- In strategy, [William Ocasio (Illinois)](https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/profile/william-ocasio) wrote a lot about what is now known as “the attention-based view” in the field.  His most famous paper is: “Towards an attention‐based view of the firm” in SMJ. “Attention to attention” in Organization Science is also a highly cited paper.  See also “Communication and attention dynamics: An attention‐based view of strategic change” and found it interesting too.  Ocasio is primarily a theorist, writing a lot of conceptual/theoretical papers.
