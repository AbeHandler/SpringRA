### A Review of the Attention Economy for Information Systems Research

## Overview

- This document describes a project plan for Spring 2026 for a graduate research assistant from the Leeds School of Business.
- **The goal is to write an ICIS review paper** on the attention economy and how the attention economy presents new questions and new directions for platform researchers in IS.
- The intended consumers of the survey are IS scholars interested in platforms and online ecosystems, who may not have considered the specific role that such platforms play in shaping and directing our attention.

## Major questions

- There are two main questions. Each question corresponds to an area to review. Each also corresponds to a sub-unit for the RA.

- **Q1.** What are the big open questions about the attention economy in reference disciplines like economics, as well as peer disciplines like strategy, management, and marketing? How has the attention economy been conceptualized and theorized? What are the grand challenges in this area? Look at FT50 and Econ journals to answer. What has been published about the attention economy there?
- **Q2.** How do these bigger questions about the attention economy relate to specific affordances of platform information systems such as like buttons, comments, recommendation algorithms, friending, etc. 
	- For example, maybe economics conceptualizes the attention economy as matching consumer interests with niche content. That conceptualization may be a better fit for platforms with a search bar (go find stuff you are interested in) and a worse fit for platforms with recommendation systems (go look at this thing). To understand the specific affordances of online platforms, look at work from CS, psychology, marketing, and IS. For example, there will be work in psych on how hard it is to look away from your phone. Finding a survey that lists platform affordances and then searching for papers about each affordance may help.

## Goals

- **Primary goal**: Submit an ICIS review paper in May 2026
- **Secondary goal**: Learn about the attention economy for future study of the YouTube recommendation algorithm
- **Stretch goal**: Convert the ICIS submission into the lit review for a journal paper on the YouTube algorithm

## Project plan

- **Phase 1**: Review of work on the attention economy in economics and reference disciplines (6 weeks)
	- 1. What has been written about this in Econ?
	- 2. What has been written about this in FT50 journals?
- **Phase 2**: Review of specific affordances of platform information systems (6 weeks)
	- 1. What has been written about this in CS, psych, and marketing? We will need to narrow down the affordances systematically somehow.
- **Phase 3**: Writing and discussion (4 weeks)
	- Write up the work from the previous two phases.
	- Something to consider for discussion: how do these big questions from reference disciplines, and known findings about specific affordances relate to ongoing conversations within IS. For example, within IS, there is a literature on recommendation systems. How do big questions about the attention economy and specific affordances of online systems introduce new questions for this research area?

## Expectations

- The research assistant (RA) is expected to work 20 hours per week on the project, following the weekly project plan outlined in this repo.
- The supervisor is expected to meet weekly with the RA for 30 minutes to provide feedback and assess progress on the project plan.
- There are 16 folders in the repo under the `weekly` folder corresponding to the 16 weeks of planned work (20 hr/wk).
- Each of the 16 folders contains a markdown report (`report.md`) listing the deliverables for that week.
- The supervisor and RA will use the `weekly` folders to monitor progress. The supervisor and RA will fill out the markdown files in each weekly folder as we go. 
- The supervisor is responsible for emailing a copy of the weekly markdown report to the graduate program director (GPD) to provide a progress update.
- The supervisor expects that the research assistant meets each weekly deliverable on the project. 
- It should be possible to complete the deliverable in 2 full days of work, more or less. If it seems like the deliverables are too demanding or not demanding enough, the RA and the supervisor can adjust as needed. 

## Important deadlines and weekly time table
- The supervisor will review weekly deliverables every **Friday at 5:00 PM**.
- The RA is responsible for submitting all weekly deliverables to this repo by **Friday at 5:00 PM**.
- The RA supervisor will email a copy of the weekly `report.md` to the graduate program director by **Monday at 5:00 PM**.

## Tools
- The RA is encouraged to use AI tools. However, the RA is ultimately responsible for both the correctness and quality of their work.
- Whenever possible, please add all deliverables to this repo.
- Please use [dvc](https://dvc.org/) for any big files that you can't fit in this repo.
