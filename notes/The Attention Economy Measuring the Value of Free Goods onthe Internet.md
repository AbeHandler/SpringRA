- Free online goods are positive. They are a consumer surplus. It’s something good that they’re getting. That they don’t have to pay for.
- GDP can’t measure this
- Why do they think there is a surplus? What is argument for this? Is it just interpretation?
- Part of it is that people are spending more time online.
- There is an aspect of this that has to do with Internet hours vs. TV hours
- People rationally allocate hours to internet
- They have some formal assumptions. One of them is that they assume all internet goods are the same.
