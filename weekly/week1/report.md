## ✅ Scope of Work

_Describe the weekly deliverables_

There are kind of two views of the attention economy. One view which we see from [Tim Wu](notes/Tim%20Wu's%20The%20Attention%20Merchants.md) is that people are being manipulated into spending time on free platforms so tech companies can sell their attention. Another view from Brynjolfsson et al.\ and the work they cite is that people are getting a nice surpluss from online goods. These are kind of in tension. To help understand these incommensurate views review empirical work on the attention economy from econ-oriented outlets. 

There are two sub-tasks here.

1. Brynjolfsson et al. [cite](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/isre.2021.0153) work on empirical studies that say people would pay \$50 a month for Facebook. Look at the stuff they cite. Is it convincing?

> `Our welfare estimates can be compared with otherestimates of the internet’s potential value. As noted, Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) first used the time value ofleisure to estimate the opportunity cost and value ofinternet use. Brynjolfsson et al. (2019) estimate the valueof a variety of free goods via online choice experiments,for instance, finding that the median user would needto be paid almost $50 to stop using Facebook for one month. Nakamura et al. (2016) estimate that the produc-tivity impact of free apps increased by 1% per year inthe internet media sector. Varian (2006) presents anannual value of $120 billion for Google’s search enginebased on the value of time savings to average users.Corrado et al. (2009) conclude that investment spendinghas increasingly shifted toward intangibles. Byrne et al.(2016) find that consumers are more productive whenusing their nonmarket time to produce services theyvalue, such as Google searches and Facebook. Our find-ing is also consistent with the prediction that the wel-fare gain from time savings for households with higherinternet usage level will increase as more content andapplications become available (Nevo et al. 2016)`


2. There are three recent AER papers on the evils of social media. Are they convincing? What do they say?
- `The Welfare Effects of Social Media` [Allcott et al. 2020](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190658)
- `Digital Addition` [Allcott et al. 2020](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20210867)
- `Social media and mental health` [Braghieri et al. 2022](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20211218)

Questions for Shuai:
- Do you know markdown? Obsidian? GitHub?

## 🏁 Evaluation criteria

_How will the RA supervisor determine that the work has been completed?_


At a high level, your job is to become the expert on our team about the empirical findings in these papers. There are some more concrete subtasks for that. But the main thing is to be the expert about the findings.

Subtasks:
-  Pull the PDFs for these papers and store them in the `pdfs` folder following the organization and naming convention
-  Write a short report for each paper in the `notes` folder. This is a good opportunity to learn Obsidian, but you can just use plain markdown. Your notes can be informal. Just jot down the main findings from the paper, things you notice. 
- Write a 1-page synopsis of the empirical work and main findings. Its OK to use GenAI tools to help write or edit the report. But it's your job to figure out what the report should say in the first place! What are some of the main findings from these papers? Why do they reach different conclusions about the attention economy, consumer surpluss, etc.
